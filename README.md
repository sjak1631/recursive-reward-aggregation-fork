## Docker

You can build and run the Docker container as follows.

### Step 1: Build the Docker image

```sh
cd docker
docker build -t rra_image . -f Dockerfile 
```

### Step 2: Run the Docker container

```sh
docker run -dit -p 8888:22 --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/your/RRA,destination=/workspace/RRA --name rra_container -m 16g --gpus all rra_image /bin/bash
```

Replace `/path/to/your/RRA` with the absolute path to your local RRA directory.

### Step 3: Enter the running container

Once the container is up and running, you can access its shell with:

```sh
docker exec -it rra_container bash
```

### Additional Setup for Experiments

To run Continuous Control and Portfolio experiments inside the Docker container, you will also need to manually install:

```sh
pip install torch stable-baselines3 empyrical tensorboard distrax IPython
```

Make sure to run this inside the container after building it.

### Tips

If you encounter issues with **Cython**, try the following:

```sh
pip uninstall Cython
pip install Cython==3.0.0a10
```

This can resolve version conflicts or compatibility issues with certain dependencies.

## Experiments

### Portfolio Experiment

This script runs the portfolio experiment using pre-defined market environments and settings.

```sh
cd portfolio
./run_portfolio.sh
```
